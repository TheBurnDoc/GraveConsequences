Prepare for...

==================
GRAVE CONSEQUENCES
==================

In this directory you will find the Android APK file which can be dropped onto an Android 
tablet. The package is in Corona 'trial mode' so you will need to go through the nag 
screen to play.

Alternatively you can run the game in the Corona SDK simulator which can be downloaded at:

https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/corona-sdk

To run this in the simulator simply open the main.lua file in the simulator.

See you out there!
